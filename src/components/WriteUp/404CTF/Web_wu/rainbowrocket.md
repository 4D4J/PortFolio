### Step 2: Analyse the login request 

When i click on the login button, BurpSuite intercept the request and something interesting pop on the screen

We can see a interesting entry in the request header, a Cookie ***token=eyJhbGci0iJSUzI1N ...***
My extension *JWT Editor* show me the token was a JWT

### Step 3: Analyse the JWT

The JWT have three parts, the **Header**, the **Payload** ad the **Signature**

Inside the Payload we see my username and a timestamp, the first things we can try it's to modifie the payload.
The main page show

You need to be admin to show this page 
```
So, instinctively i change Rapdio1234 by Admin
